This online platform facilitates volunteers at a city farm to register for open volunteer slots using a communal calendar. Volunteers can reserve available slots, cancel their bookings, and access information about their upcoming sessions. Managers have visibility into any sessions that still need volunteers.
Please note that slots are available only from October 1st to October 10th 2023.

The objective is to maintain steady volunteer attendance for both morning and evening sessions, providing volunteers with a simple method to schedule and oversee their commitments.
